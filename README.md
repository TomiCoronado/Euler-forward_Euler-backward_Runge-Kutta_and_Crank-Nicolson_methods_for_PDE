# Euler-forward_Euler-backward_Runge-Kutta_and_Crank-Nicolson_methods_for_PDE
Euler forward, Euler backward, Runge Kutta and Crank Nicolson methods for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDE), with an initial value (Initial Value Problems, or IVP).

---
The problem is solved in C programming language. The results are saved in a .csv file and after that they are visualized with Python.
